v1.0.0 Changelog
- Initial release

1.0.1
-Added compat.cs that will support mods that need to be added.
-Added support for moreanimals mod.

1.1.1
-Added caught animal info to the mouse hoverover/tool tip. Auto localizes from available vanilla or mod content- if a mod added something unusual it will still try to resolve a proper name, and then falls back to a simple English word like 'Baby'. If the mod is not localizing into your language for vanilla content let me know. :)
-Update is backwards compatible with all verisons of this mod, safe to install on existing saves and will update currently held animals to show tooltip.
-New logic in the event of 'failure' to find names should never crash your game. (Not that it did before, just sayin' guards were made to prevent that! :)
